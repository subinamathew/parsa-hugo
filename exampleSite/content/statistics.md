  > “It seems so obvious: If we invent a machine, the first thing we are going to do—after making a profit—is use it to watch porn.” – Damon Brown, Author of Playboy’s Greatest Covers

  It’s projected that virtual reality (VR) porn should be a **$1 billion business** by the year 2025. That’s third behind an expected $1.4 billion virtual reality video game market and $1.23 billion VR NFL-related content.

  ![VR Business](https://www.covenanteyes.com/lemonade/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/projected-VR-business.png =626x196)

  Pornographers are hoping VR porn will boost porn website revenues that have been mostly stagnant from 2010 to 2015. In that time, adult content increased roughly 0.3% to **$3.3 billion**.

  ![VR revenue](https://www.covenanteyes.com/lemonade/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/icon-for-hopes-VR-boosts-revenue-1-1.png =150x161)

  In 2006, estimated revenues for sex-related entertainment businesses were just under **$13 billion** in the US. These estimates included video sales and rentals, Internet sales, cable, pay-per-view, phone sex, exotic dance clubs magazines, and novelty stores.

  **28,258 users** are watching pornography every second.

  **$3,075.64 is spent on porn** every second on the Internet.

  **88% of scenes in porn films** contain acts of physical aggression, and 49% of scenes contain verbal aggression.

  **79% of porn performers** have used marijuana, and 50% have used ecstasy.

  **1 in 5** mobile searches are for pornography.

  > “Amateurs come across better on screen. Our customers feel that. Especially by women you can see it. They still feel strong pain.” – Carlo Scalisi, Owner of 21 Sexury Video

  **71% of teens** hide online behavior from their parents.

  A 2016 study on Canadian adolescents showed that 45.3% admitted to problems in erectile dysfunction.

  > “The young women who talk to me on campuses about the effect of pornography on their intimate lives speak of feeling that they can never measure up, that they can never ask for what they want; and that if they do not offer what porn offers, they cannot expect to hold a guy. The young men talk about what it is like to grow up learning about sex from porn, and how it is not helpful to them in trying to figure out how to be with a real woman…For the first time in human history, the images’ power and allure have supplanted that of real naked women. Today, real naked women are just bad porn.”

  > – Naomi Wolf

  ## Pornography and Marriage Stats

  > “I have also seen in my clinical experience that pornography damages the sexual performance of the viewers. Pornography viewers tend to have problems with premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction. Having spent so much time in unnatural sexual experiences with paper, celluloid and cyberspace, they seem to find it difficult to have sex with a real human being. Pornography is raising their expectation and demand for types and amounts of sexual experiences; at the same time it is reducing their ability to experience sex.”

  > – Dr. MaryAnne Layden
