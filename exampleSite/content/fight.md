# Lets Fight It Together

Jesus Christ has defeated this enemy on the cross for us. It us to realise that and win the battle, but this is not a realisation of the mind but it also involves a heart that submits to the victory of Jesus and His rule over our brains and body, Jesus says that the Holy Spirit is send for such a reason. 
* _Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God_[ (ESV Bible)]( http://esv.to/Romans8:26)
